# Mini-Project Reflection

During this semester, I have learned several skills and principles that were useful in completing the mini-project. These include:

- **Modularization and testing:** I learned how to break down code into smaller, more manageable modules and how to test each module to ensure its correctness.
- **DRY principle:** The principle of "Don't Repeat Yourself" was helpful in avoiding code duplication and improving code maintainability.
- **Creating maintainable, modular, and reusable code:** I understood the importance of writing code that is easy to maintain, modular, and reusable.
- **Software testing methodologies:** I learned about various testing methodologies
- **Version control systems:** I gained experience in using Git to manage code changes and collaborate with other team members.

To complete the mini-project, I also had to learn some new skills, such as:

- [**Working with maps:**](https://github.com/SLUSE-Spring2022/miniproject-java/blob/main/SmartFridgeContents.java) The code made use of the Map interface to store and manipulate key-value pairs.
- **Error handling:** The code used try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions that may occur during runtime.
- **Working with multiple modules:** The code imported variables and functions from another module, which required an understanding of how modules work and how to access variables and functions from other modules.

The biggest challenge I faced during the mini-project was deciding on a suitable project idea and scope, and breaking down the project into manageable tasks. Additionally, I had to figure out how to represent the pantry contents and the recipes in a data structure, as well as how to calculate what items need to be purchased and how many. Finally, I needed to ensure that the program was user-friendly by providing clear instructions and feedback to the user throughout the execution of the program.

Overall, the mini-project was a great opportunity to practice my Java programming skills and learn how to design and implement a simple application that solves a real-world problem.
