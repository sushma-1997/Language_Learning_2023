## Java Primitive Data Types and Operators

Java has several [types of operators](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/my-pages/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%202/Operators.java)
, including:
- Arithmetic operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Assignment operators
- Increment/decrement operators
- Ternary operators
- Bitwise operators

Java has eight [primitive data types](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/my-pages/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%202/PrimitiveDataTypes.java):
- Four to store whole numbers (byte, short, int, long)
- Two to store real numbers (float, double)
- One for single characters (char)
- One for boolean values (boolean)

Each numeric data type has a specified range of values, and an overflow or underflow can occur if a value is outside of that range. The wrapper class provides additional functionality for each primitive data type and can be used to retrieve basic information, such as the minimum and maximum values.

The size of each primitive type varies, with the `int` being Java's default data type for whole numbers and occupying the largest amount of memory (32 bits). Numeric literals can have a suffix appended to force a different data type from the default type, such as the `long`, which has a suffix of 'L' and requires 64 bits of memory.

### Difference between int and long in Java
The difference between `int` and `long` in Java is the range of values they can hold. `Long` has a larger range than `int`, but it also has the same overflow and underflow problems as other primitive data types. The 'L' suffix is used to specify that a number should be treated as `long`. If an `int` is assigned to a `long`, Java will automatically convert it to a `long`, but if a number is too large to be an `int`, an error will occur if the 'L' suffix is not used.
