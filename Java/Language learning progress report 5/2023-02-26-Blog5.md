## Introduction

In my journey of learning Java programming, I have explored the concept of methods and method overloading. This week, I have gained a deeper understanding of how to write efficient and reusable code through the use of methods. I have also learned how to overload methods, allowing me to create multiple versions of a method with different parameters.
