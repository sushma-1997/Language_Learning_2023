## Introduction

In my journey of learning Java programming, I have explored the concept of methods and method overloading. This week, I have gained a deeper understanding of how to write efficient and reusable code through the use of methods. I have also learned how to overload methods, allowing me to create multiple versions of a method with different parameters. 

## Method in Java

In Java, a method is a block of code that performs a specific task. Methods are used to organize code into smaller, reusable pieces that can be called from other parts of a program. They can also accept arguments, which are values passed into the method when it is called, and return a value to the calling code.

Here is the [syntax](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%205/methodsSyntax.java) for defining a method in Java:
<ul>
  
The **access-modifier** specifies the visibility of the method, such as public, private, or protected.

The **return-type** specifies the data type of the value returned by the method, or void if the method doesn't return a value.

The **method-name** is the name of the method, which is used to call the method from other parts of the program.

The **parameter-list** is a comma-separated list of the input parameters to the method, which are used to pass values into the method when it is called.

The **method body** is the code that performs the specific task of the method.

The **return statement** is used to return a value from the method, which must match the return-type specified in the method signature.
 </ul>
 
### Methods in Java are code blocks that perform specific tasks and can be called from other parts of a program. Here are some examples of methods in Java:

#### [Method with no arguments and no return value](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%205/simpleMethod.java):

This method is public, has no arguments, and returns void (i.e., nothing). When called, it simply prints "Hello!" to the console.

#### [Method with arguments and a return value](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%205/methodWithArgAndReturnVal.java):

This method is public, takes two integer arguments, and returns their sum as an integer. When called, it takes two integers, adds them together, and returns the result.

#### [Method with a default parameter value](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%205/methodWithDefaultParam.java):

This method is public, takes a string argument for a name and a string argument for a prefix (which defaults to an empty string if null is passed in), and returns void. When called, it prints out a message that includes the prefix and name.

#### [Method that throws an exception](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%205/methodWithException.java):

This method is public, takes two integer arguments (numerator and denominator), and returns the result of dividing them (as a double). However, if the denominator is zero, it throws an ArithmeticException with a custom error message. When called, it either returns the division result or throws an exception.

Here is an [example](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%205/sumOfTwoIntegers.java) of a simple method in Java that takes two integers as input and returns their sum:
<ul>

The public keyword specifies that this method can be called from any other class in the program.
  
The int keyword specifies that this method returns an integer value.
  
The add is the name of the method.
  
The (int num1, int num2) is the list of parameters that this method accepts. These are two integer values that will be passed into the method.
  
The int sum = num1 + num2; is the code that performs the specific task of the method.
  
The return sum; statement returns the value of the sum variable to the calling code.

</ul>

To call this method from another part of the program, we would use the [following code](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%205/callingMethod.java):

## Method Overloading 

Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. This enables developers to create methods that perform similar tasks but with different input parameters, which can help make the code more flexible and easier to read.

Here's an [example](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%205/methodOverloading.java) of method overloading in Java:

In this example, the Calculator class has three methods named add, but each one has a different parameter list. The first method takes two int parameters and returns their sum as an int. The second method takes three int parameters and returns their sum as an int. The third method takes two double parameters and returns their sum as a double.

To call these methods, you can simply use the same method name with different arguments, and Java will automatically determine which method to call based on the number and types of arguments provided:

In this [example](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%205/methodWithTypeOfArgument.java), the first call to add will invoke the first method, which takes two int parameters and returns an int value of 5. The second call to add will invoke the second method, which takes three int parameters and returns an int value of 9. The third call to add will invoke the third method, which takes two double parameters and returns a double value of 6.2.

## Challenge:

I was trying to create a program that would calculate the area of different shapes, such as circles, rectangles, and triangles. However, I quickly realized that each shape requires a different formula to calculate its area.

To solve this problem, I learned about method overloading in Java. I created a class called AreaCalculator that had different methods for each shape, all named calculateArea. Each method had a different set of parameters based on the shape it was calculating the area for. For example, the method for calculating the area of a circle had only one parameter, the radius, while the method for calculating the area of a rectangle had two parameters, the length and width.

Here's an [example](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%205/areaCalculator.java) of what the AreaCalculator class :

As you can see, each method has a different set of parameters, but they all have the same name, calculateArea. This allows me to call the appropriate method based on the shape I want to calculate the area for, without having to create a separate method for each shape.

Here's an [example](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%205/callingAreaCalculator.java) of how I used the AreaCalculator class to calculate the areas of different shapes:

In this example, the calculateArea method with one parameter is used to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5.0, the method with two parameters is used to calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 10.0 and a width of 5.0, and the method with three parameters is used to calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 4.0 and a height of 3.0.

Using method overloading in this way allowed me to create a program that could calculate the areas of different shapes without having to write a separate method for each shape. It also made the code more readable and easier to maintain.
