# Understanding Control Flow and Variable Scope in Java

In the world of programming, understanding control flow and variable scope are fundamental concepts that help developers write efficient and reliable code. In Java, these concepts are particularly important because they play a critical role in the language's structure and execution.

## Switch Statement

The switch statement in Java allows you to test the value of a variable and execute different code blocks depending on the value. Here is the general [syntax](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%206/switchSyntax.java) for a switch statement:


The expression in the switch statement is the value that is being tested. Each case specifies a value that the expression can be equal to, and the corresponding code block is executed if the expression matches that value. The break statement is used to exit the switch statement after the code block is executed. If none of the specified values match the expression, the default code block is executed.

Here is an [example](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%206/switchExample.java) of a switch statement in Java:

In this example, we use a switch statement to set the value of the dayName string based on the value of the dayOfWeek variable. The dayOfWeek variable has a value of 3, so the dayName variable will be set to "Wednesday".

## While loop

The while loop in Java allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. Here is the general [syntax](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%206/whileSyntax.java) for a while loop:

The condition in the while loop is a boolean expression that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the code block is executed. If the condition is false, the loop is exited.

Here is an [example](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%206/whileExample.java) of a while loop in Java:

In this example, we use a while loop to print out the values of i from 0 to 9. The condition in the while loop is i < 10, so the loop will continue to execute as long as i is less than 10. The i variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
In Java, a variable's scope refers to the parts of the program where the variable is accessible. Local variables are variables that are declared inside a method or a block of code and are only accessible within that method or block of code. Here's an example to help illustrate the concept:

 ## Do-while loop
 
The do-while loop in Java is similar to the while loop, but it always executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition. Here is the general [syntax](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%206/doWhileSyntax.java) for a do-while loop:

The condition in the do-while loop is a boolean expression that is evaluated after each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the loop continues to execute. If the condition is false

In Java, a variable's scope refers to the parts of the program where the variable is accessible. Local variables are variables that are declared inside a method or a block of code and are only accessible within that method or block of code. Here's an [example](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%206/variablesExample.java) to help illustrate the concept:

In this example, x is a local variable within the myMethod() method. It is not accessible outside of that method, including in the anotherMethod() method.

Here's another [example](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%206/anotherVarExample.java) that shows how the scope of a variable can change within nested blocks of code:

In this example, y is a local variable within the if block of code. It is not accessible outside of that block, including after the if block. x is still accessible after the if block because it was declared in the outer myMethod() method.

It's important to note that if a local variable has the same name as a variable in a higher scope, the local variable will "shadow" the higher scope variable. Here's an [example](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%206/varShadow.java) to illustrate:

In this example, x is a variable in the higher scope outside of myMethod(). Within myMethod(), a local variable also named x is declared and given a value of 10. When x is printed within myMethod(), it will print 10, not 5. However, when x is printed within anotherMethod(), it will access the higher scope x variable and print 5

## Challenge

### Problem Statement:

You are working on a small project that simulates a simple calculator. The calculator should allow the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Implement the following functions using switch statements, while and do-while loops, local variables, and scope:

add() - A function that adds two numbers.
subtract() - A function that subtracts two numbers.
multiply() - A function that multiplies two numbers.
divide() - A function that divides two numbers.
You should also implement the following requirements:

The user should be prompted to enter two numbers and an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) until they choose to quit.
If the user enters an invalid operation, the program should display an error message and ask for the operation again.
The result of the operation should be displayed to the user.

Here's the [solution](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%206/Challenge.java) that utilizes switch statements, while and do-while loops, local variables, and scope:

In this solution, we first declare a Scanner object to read user input and a boolean variable continueProgram to control whether the user wants to continue using the calculator or not. Inside the do-while loop, we prompt the user to enter the first number, second number, and operation (add, subtract, multiply, or divide).

We use a switch statement to determine which operation the user wants to perform and call the corresponding function (add, subtract, multiply, or divide). If the user enters an invalid operation or attempts to divide by zero, an error message is displayed and the program asks the user to enter the operation again.

After the operation is performed, the result is displayed to the user. Then the program asks the user whether they want to perform another operation or quit. If the user chooses to quit, the continueProgram variable is set to false and the loop exits. Otherwise, the loop continues and prompts the user for another operation.
