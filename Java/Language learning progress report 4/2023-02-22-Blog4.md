This week, I have delved deeper into the world of Java programming. I have learned more about the importance of keywords and expressions in Java, and the significance of statements, whitespace, and indentation for code organization. Additionally, I have explored the concept of code blocks and if-else control statements.


## Keywords and Expressions in Java

Keywords and expressions are fundamental concepts in programming, and understanding them is essential to become a proficient programmer in Java.


### Keywords

Keywords in Java are reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers such as variable names or method names. Here are some examples of [Java keywords](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%204/keywords.txt):


### Expressions

On the other hand, expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators that evaluate to a single value. Java expressions can be as simple as a variable or a constant, or they can be complex expressions involving arithmetic or logical operators.

Here's an [example](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%204/keywordsAndexpressions.java) of Java code that uses both keywords and expressions:

In this code, public, class, static, void, int, if, and else are all Java keywords. The expressions in the code include a, b, a + b, and c > 15.

Overall, understanding keywords and expressions is crucial to writing effective Java code.



## Statements, Whitespace, and Indentation for Code Organization in Java

Statements, whitespace, and indentation are important for code organization in Java.

In Java, statements are instructions that are executed by the program. They can be simple or complex, and they can perform a wide range of tasks.

Whitespace refers to spaces, tabs, and line breaks in your code. While whitespace is not necessary for the compiler to understand your code, it is important for code readability and organization.

Indentation refers to the use of whitespace to visually separate blocks of code. Indentation makes your code easier to read and understand, especially for complex code blocks.

Here's an [example](https://github.com/sushma-1997/Language_Learning_2023/blob/main/Java/Language%20learning%20progress%20report%204/codeOrganization.java) of Java code that demonstrates the use of statements, whitespace, and indentation for code organization:

In this code, we use the if-else control statement to evaluate whether num1 is less than num2. The statements inside the curly braces are indented to visually separate the code block. The use of whitespace and indentation makes the code easier to read and understand.

Overall, proper use of statements, whitespace, and indentation is crucial for writing well-organized and readable Java code.
